# Glued Doubly Linked List (Glthreads)

Redefine the traditional doubly-linked list based on the glue concept, for learning. Glued DLL node do not contain a pointer to application data in its definition, unlike the node of traditional linked list. The glue node is just a set of pointers which indicates previous and next nodes and is attached to application data structure definition. Application data can be obtained from the offset calculated by the glue position and the application data address.

## Benefits

One can enjoy the main benefits of glthreads in the multi-reference scenario. It is the case when multiple data structures (like linked list) can refer to same application data simultaneously. Firstly, the number of system call to allocate memory (e.g. malloc) can be reduced compared to the traditional DLL, since all the glue nodes are allocated once as the application data member while the traditional DLL needs to allocate node memory per number of data strucutres for references. In addition, glthreads has lower time complexity of data deletion than traditional DLL. One iteration of application data structure, reconnection and free of the data suffice for the glthreads, which leads to O(n) plus O(1) multiplied by the number of data structures. On the other hand, traditional linked list requires to iterate all the data structures, find the corresponding nodes and delete all of those. This leads to O(n) multiplied by the number of data structure.
